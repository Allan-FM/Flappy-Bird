# Flapp-Bird-Clone

### Flappy Bird game clone
The objective in the game is to earn as many points as possible by
controlling a bird (by touching the screen) without letting it crash into the
pipes. If the bird touches an obstacle or if the bird is dropped, the game is
over.
This game uses game development fundamentals with: Sorting Layers,
Scriptable Objects, Score and Game Manager, DOTween, UI, Fade and
Flash.
